# C-Programming

## Exercise 1

Write a C program that takes the name of a file as a command-line argument, opens the file, reads through it to determine the number of words in each sentence, displays the total number of words and sentences, and computes the average number of words per sentence. The results should be printed in a table (as standard output), such as shown below:

This program counts the words and sentences in file "comp.text".
Sentence: 1 Words: 29
Sentence: 2 Words: 41
Sentence: 3 Words: 16
Sentence: 4 Words: 22
Sentence: 5 Words: 44
Sentence: 6 Words: 14
Sentence: 7 Words: 32
File "comp.text" contains 198 words words in  7 sentences for an average of 28.3 words per sentence.

In this program, you should count a word as any contiguous sequence of letters, and apostrophes should be ignored. Thus, "O'Henry", "government's", and "friend's" should each be considered as one word.
